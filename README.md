# Prediction of Outlet Sales

### Outlet Sales using Linear Regression

##### Author: Robert Yonce

### Business Problem:
  - Create a model to help predict the future Item Outlet Sales 

### Data:
  - Sales Data used: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTOdd9ucw6tCewOdXmi_zGCnXLdAtUKs1-k5KgSD6TDSkPx6z4ptifobdRcUE-JYhX6IIBziuMvQoVZ/pub?output=csv
  
### Methods:
  - To fill in the missing values, I used the most frequent method for categories and the median involving any numbers.
		- These processes were chosen as they are simple but effective ways to help fill out the entire data set.
	- From there I prepped the data so I could test models on the data given to help see which model would help predict from future data given.
		- The two models tested were Linear Regression and Decision Tree Model.

### Results
